Microservice Architecture
    1. What is it?
        - Application built from independent, modular services
        - Services communicate with standard protocols
        - Each service is distinct and purpose built (loose coupling)
    2. Why?
        - Independent development
        - Problems can be localized
    3. Reality
        - Requires careful planning and discipline
        - Errors can affect multiple services
        - Determining root causes can be difficult
