Databases - A usually large dcolleciton of data organized especially for rapid search and retrieval.

Historical Data Saving:
    1. Text Files
    2. Embedded/File-Based
    3. Relational
    4. Enterprise DBMS - Oracle, IBM, MS SQL
    5. Open-Source DBMS - MySQL, PostgreSQL

Relational Databases
    1. Schemas - Table, Table Structure, Relation between records
    2. Relations
        - 1:1, A student has one place of birth
        - 1:n, A college has many students
        - m:n, A subject has many students and a student has many subjects
    3. Entity Relationship Diagrams
    4. ACID Transactions
        - Atomicity, all or nothing
        - Consistency, tranform from one valid state to another
        - Isolation, Concurrent transactions leave the data in a state as if they were executed in sequence
        - Durability, data is persistently stored.

Document/NoSQL Databases
    1. No integrity through Relations
    2. Not ACID compliant
    3. Schema-Less, no defined data Structure
    4. Can store arbitray data
    5. Schema management occurs in application

Document Databases
    1. MongoDB
        - mongoimport --username username --password password --host databaseWithPort --db dbName --collection collectionName --file dbFile --type type --headerline 
    2. Redis, key-value
    3. Couchbase
    4. CouchDB
    5. DynamoDB, key-value
    6. Cassandra
    7. Amazon Web Services

Relational Databases
    1. Oracle
    2. IBM Db2
    3. Microsoft SQL Server
    4. MySQL
    5. SQLite
    6. PostgreSQL
